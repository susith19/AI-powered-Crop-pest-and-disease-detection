AI-Driven Drone for Plant Disease Prediction

Project Status: ðŸš§ Under Development

Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered drone system that can predict plant diseases by analyzing images of crops. The drone captures images, processes them using machine learning models, and sends the analyzed data to a dedicated application for farmers and researchers. IoT integration enhances real-time monitoring and data collection.

Features

AI-Based Disease Detection: Uses deep learning models to identify plant diseases.

Drone Integration: Captures images of crops autonomously.

IoT Connectivity: Sends real-time environmental and disease data to the cloud.

Mobile & Web App Support: Displays disease predictions and recommendations.

Automated Alerts: Notifies farmers about detected diseases and possible treatments.


Technologies Used

AI/ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV

Drone Control: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or similar hardware

IoT: NodeMCU, MQTT, Firebase

Backend: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js

Frontend: React.js, Flutter (for mobile app)

Database: Firebase, PostgreSQL


Installation (To Be Updated)

Instructions for setting up the project will be added after development progresses.

Future Scope

Enhancing AI model accuracy with more diverse datasets.

Improving real-time processing speed.

Integrating weather and soil data for better disease prediction.
